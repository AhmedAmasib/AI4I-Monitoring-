# AI4I-Monitoring-
In This Project We monitor machine vibration and temperature to predict failures (HDF/TWF). And our goal is  Shift to predictive maintenance to improve product quality and machine uptime and the scale of Success KPIs: F1 Score >= 0.85 for anomaly detection and P95 Latency =&lt; 50 ms for real-time alerting via AWS SageMaker.
